# nikostack
My minimalist stack stack made for creating multiple types of projects. A simple stack composed by stuff i like and i'm productive using.

## nikostack-web
This is my stack for anything web related, from simple landing pages to microservices and saas. Ensuring simplicity and control over using only what i *actually* need, and scalable by adding more npm packages, frameworks, libraries or whatever. All shipped together on the CLI tool.
- HTML, Pure PHP or NextJS
- PicoCSS, Brush(invite-beta) or TailwindCSS
- PureJS
- MySQL

## nikostack-desktop
This is my stack for making desktop apps and/or wrappers for webstuff.
- Electron or Tauri (still didn't got much out of it)
- HTML or NextJS
- PicoCSS, Brush(invite-beta) or TailwindCSS
- PureJS or Typescript
- MySQL

## nikostack-mobile [experimental]
This is a current experiment since i don't develop much mobile stuff. But when i do make some little apps this is my approach
- React native, Expo or Tauri(beta)
- PicoCSS, Brush(invite-beta) or TailwindCSS
- PureJS or Typescript
- MySQL
